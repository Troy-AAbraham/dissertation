This repository contains scripts developed as part of my dissertation on the Rutan Boomerang aircraft. The scripts include:

Aerodynamic and Propulsion Models: Models for simulating the aircraft’s aerodynamic and propulsion characteristics.

Linearized Dynamic Analysis: Code for performing linearized dynamic analysis to assess the dynamic stability of the aircraft.

Parameter Sweep Study: A study on the effect of bank angle on the aircraft’s dynamic stability.

Simply run the relevant scripts in Python to perform the analyses.
